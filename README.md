## Presentation 
This project was developed in **Unity** by a team of four to prototype a simulation racing game in order to train on it, an agent with machine learning and transfer it to the other prototype we made, an [Arcade prototype](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Transfert-Research/Arcade-Prototype).

## Setup
Warning: Make sure to have installed the python environment

### Start a training session
In [**Anaconda Prompt**](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [**MiniForge Prompt**](https://conda-forge.org/download/)
1. Go to the project folder
2. Activate the python environment
``` 
conda activate mlagents
```
3. Start training
```
mlagents-learn config/AgentSimulationBehavior_config.yaml --run-id=Training_Name
```

In **Unity** 
1. Open the scene ```Assets/Scenes/Training```
2. **Launch** the scene

### Test trained agents
In **Unity** 
1. Open the scene ```Assets/Scenes/MainCircuit```
2. Get an ```.onnx``` file from the folder ```Result``` in the ```Assets/Results```
3. In the *Hierarchy* ```Car Pickup``` GameObject
4. In the *Inspector* ```Behavior Parameters``` Script
5. Change the parameters ```Model``` with the neural network you want to test. Make sure that ```Behavior Type``` is set to *Inference Only*
4. **Launch** the scene

### Play agent
---
1. Open either the scene **MainCircuit** or **Training**
2. On the car pickup, in the component Behavior Parameters 
    - Change the Behavior Type to *Heuristic Only*

## Technology
- Unity 6 *v6000.3.9f1*
- [ML Agents Plugin](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ml-agents@4.0/manual/index.html) *(version 4.0.2)*
